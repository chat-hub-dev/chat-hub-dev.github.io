    <div class="answer" id="answer-5">
      <p>The website's lack of security stems from the absence of an SSL certificate that needs to be installed on the server.

    <div class="answer" id="answer-7">
      <p>Accessing the website using a mobile phone is technically possible, but it is not recommended or optimized due to the website being primarily developed for desktop PCs.

It is advised to use a desktop or laptop computer to fully utilize the features and navigate the website as intended.</p>

     <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(9)">‚ùì Why are my chat message gone?</div>
     <div class="answer" id="answer-9">
      <p>
        The reason you may find the chat either empty or with different messages upon returning is due to server restart. The website currently does not have its own dedicated database for persistent storage of messages. Instead, all the messages are stored in RAM (Random Access Memory). Consequently, if the server restarts, the messages stored in RAM are cleared, resulting in the chat being reset or having different content. Implementing a database solution would ensure message persistence even after server restarts.</p>
